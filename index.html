                <h3> Event</h3>
                In this event, you'll join a side and compete in Group Matches to earn Event Points which are your ticket to awesome rewards like myClub Coins.
                Additionally, if your side earns more points than the other in the Group Match Stage, it will gain an advantage in the "Grand Final", where a representative from each side competes to decide the overall winner of the event.
                Picking players from teams affiliated with your side will earn you additional points in Group Matches, making squad composition an important factor to consider in each event.
                In Matchday, even the smallest contribution can be the difference between victory and defeat, so join a side now and be the difference that matters!
                <h2>Group Match Stage</h2>

                18/07/2021 14:00 - 19/07/2021 01:59 (UTC)

                <h2> Note:</h2>

                *Event bonuses and event conditions are based on the most recent player data in the game.
                *Your rating is affected by your results in all eFootball-category matches with the exception of Grand Finals.
                *If you disconnect in the middle of the match, it might count as a loss. If it does, you will also be unable to obtain any rewards from the match. Please ensure you play the game over a stable network connection to avoid unintentional disconnections.
                *You are assigned a rating of either "A", "B", or "C" depending on how many times you have disconnected while playing against other users online. If your rating falls to category C, limitations will be imposed upon your ability to use online matchmaking.
                *You will not be able to use your own players and teams in this event.
                *Players will not gain experience from matches played in this event.
                *You can claim your Result Rewards and Grand Final Rewards starting from the end of the Grand Final match until the end of the event itself. Please note that you will not be able to claim these rewards if the Event ends while you are watching the Grand Final.
                *Users with a stable connection will be given priority to be chosen as the Representative of their Side.
                *If it is deemed difficult to match you with users in the opposing Side, you may be matched with users from your own Side.
                *Event Points earned in matches against users from your own Side allow you to gain Event Point Rewards and affect Side Rankings, but they are not used to determine which Side is winning the Group Match Stage.
                *If you do not finish your match before the end of the Group Match Stage, you will not acquire Event Points.
                *You can only spectate Grand Final matches of events in which you participated.
                *Matchday is divided into three Classes, and you are assigned a Class according to your Rating. You can view the Class you were assigned from your User Profile.
                *The event schedule and details are subject to change without prior warning.
                *If any user is deemed to have breached the User Agreement, we will enact the appropriate measures as set out in the Agreement itself.
                *Unscheduled maintenance may be held without prior notice to deal with urgent issues.
                *If maintenance is underway when a match ends, you may sometimes be unable to receive any rewards and the result may not be counted in your match records.
                *Exact start and end times may be affected by maintenance.</p></div><hr>
